This is a simple react dropdown

Technologies used - React JS, Tailwind CSS(for styling)

This react dropdown is a simple implementation of onMouseEnter/onMouseLeave event methods offered by react.
When you hover over the "Select" element, you would see the dropdown items .

Often times we tend to forget about these lesser used methods, since on majority instances, onChnage or onClick 
methods are able to provide us with the functionalities that we desire.

This is just a refresher for these methods!!

Happy learning!!.
